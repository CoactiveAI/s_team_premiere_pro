# S-Team Premiere Pro

## Overview

The goal of this is to provide the sales team yet another tool / example of how they can sell Coactive into a News/Media production use case. Often times customers are working with tools that they are already familiar with and this is a way to prove that integration. A popular production tool is [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html) and this plugin attempts to offer a way for users to remain inside Premier Pro and use Coactive Semantic search.
